Abstract: Clustering data by identifying a subset of representative examples is important for processing sensory signals and detecting patterns in data. A new clustering algorithm named “affinity propagation” was published on Science in 2007. According to the similarity between N data points, a similarity matrix (N*N) is composed by the similarity figures between each two data points. Affinity Propagation (AP), which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. And Real-valued messages are always exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.
